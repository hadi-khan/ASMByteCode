TODOS:

-Implement  code instrumentation in MethodTransformVisitor so that it invokes a method that stores all the code coverage for a given test,
then dumps it all into a file once the test ends (to prevent excess I/O).

-Implement JUnit Listener to hook onto test method lifecycle landmarks like test start and end

-Maven integration/ suss out process to add our project as an agent onto third party libraries
